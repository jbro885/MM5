# Magnus' M5 Simulator

This repository contains the simulator I used throughout my PhD and for a few of my later papers, most notably our [GDP paper at HPCA'18](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8327017). The core of the simulator is a branch from M5 but I have substantially modified it over the years. The simulator is no longer actively developed, so it is not a good starting point for new research projects.
